# [Advent of Code 2015](https://adventofcode.com/2015)

I've done that year's (2015) challenges for fun and to refresh memory about some of the basic algorithms and approaches
without deep performance optimization since I prefer idiomatic and readable code until it really needs to be much
faster, so most of the solutions are quick enough to do a job in seconds under default CPython.

### Rules:

- `Python 3.12`
- `Built-in only`
- `PEP8`
- `Type hinting`
- Linters ([Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) and [MyPy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
  via [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/index.html))
